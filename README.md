# Work Experience Chatbot

## Overview
The "Work Experience Chatbot" is a dynamic project designed to assist hiring managers and recruiters in exploring the professional background and work experience of potential candidates. As a data scientist actively seeking employment, I developed this chatbot to showcase my technical skills and professional achievements in an interactive and engaging manner.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an interactive chatbot that provides detailed information about a candidate's professional background. This tool is intended to make the screening process more efficient for recruiters and hiring managers by delivering pertinent information through a conversational interface.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can ask questions and receive information about the candidate's work experience, skills, and educational background.
- **Custom Queries Handling:** The chatbot is equipped to handle a variety of questions, ensuring that users can get the specific information they are looking for.
- **User-friendly Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit, the dashboard offers a clean and intuitive user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for building the backend logic of the chatbot.
- **Streamlit:** An open-source app framework used to create the user interface for the chatbot.
- **LangChain:** Leveraged for orchestrating the chatbot's language model and managing conversation flow.
- **Pinecone:** Utilized for managing the vector database that powers the search capabilities of the chatbot.
- **OpenAI:** Utilizes APIs from OpenAI for advanced natural language processing capabilities.
